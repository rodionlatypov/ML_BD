Gradient descent stops at convergence (when pre-defined tolerance is reached). Unless GD converges, computation stops at a pre-defined step. Our computaion converged at step 581

y's are generated as X * w + N(0, 1) (add noise which is drawn from standard normal distribution). X's are also generated randomly (from uniform distribution).

**Regression results:**
